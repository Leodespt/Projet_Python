# Conclusion of Our Project

## Romain

During this project I have learned to work on data-visualization, modeling of classifier and using a flask application.

Concerning data-visualization, I have been led to reuse the basic libraries seen during the TD: numpy, panda, matplotlib, seaborn. I learn how to work on a dataframe (group by, drop column, count) and plot multiple graphs. 

About Modeling classifier, I have discovered several types of classifiers: bagging, boosting, stacking and voting. I have also become aware of the importance of a grid search to find optimize classifiers. 

Thanks to this project I have develop a method of work to find a final model with a good accuracy (I explain it in the conclusion of our power point). 

Regarding the creation and use of a flask application. I had a lot of difficulty to understand how it worked. I have met many problems with the import and the compatibility of the libraries I needed. Thanks to this part of the project, I have developed my knowledge about the command prompt (creation and deletion of environment, installation of libraries, moving throw the drive, launching file). I also learn about the use of flash request with URL parameters. I am proud to have implemented a few html in our project and also a set up of 8 functions of verifications in order to avoid crash of the application and allows to have a clean interface.  As a bonus, I have discovered the import of python file in another python file.

This project gave me the opportunity to learn a lot of new skills, especially in data analysis and collaborative work on GitHub. Indeed, it was the first time for me that I used a Git environment, and it was not easy to understand how it worked. But at the end we managed to create a clean Github repository and after that it was extremely pleasant to work online in a collaborative environment.

Concerning data analyze and visualization, I had the possibility to reuse the libraries seen in practical work and perfect my skills on those libraries, especially seaborn which I discovered only this year and pandas with all the possibilities it gives to analyze data frames.

I also learned to work on modeling classifier and to use the sklearn library. I have learned to use the classifiers that were introduced to us during practical work session like the K neighbors Classifier and the SV Classifier (Support Vector Classifier). 

Using the Grid Search Model is also something I learned during this project and I realize it was extremely helpful to optimize an already existing classifier. Thanks to all these classifiers we managed to create models with a very good accuracy which I am pretty proud of.

Finally, I leaned to do predictions on chosen data thanks to a model we created previously. Thank to this learned knowledge, our code can predict the type of Obesity a person is facing thanks to a few information this person gives us.

This Project was very rewarding on the technical way, but also on the collaborative way, because it is always interesting to work with another person on an IT project.
